This is Tutorial for Jarge XNA version, to get your game up and running and showing "Hello, World!".

Step 1:
      Open a new project in your IDE, in my case Visual Studio, and create a new C# project.
    
Step 2:
      Right click on your solution, and add an existing project. Add the project inside the "Jarge XNA" folder. Then, right
      click on referances, "add referance", and add a referance to the Jarge project in the solution. This should set up our
      solution for Jarge Development.
      
Step 3:
      Rewrite you Program.cs to resemble to the following:
            
            #region Using Statements
            using System;
            using JargeEngine;
            #endregion
            
            namespace HelloWorld
            {
                public class Game1 : Engine
                {
                    public Game1()
                        : base("Thing foo")
                    {
                        SetScene(new GameScene());
                    }
                }
            }
      
      This will create the Engine, or base, for our Jarge Game.
      
Step 4:
      Create a new file, Call it "GameScene.cs", and add it to your project.
      
      Edit our file to resemble this:
            
            using System;
            using System.Collections.Generic;
            using System.Linq;
            using System.Text;
            using JargeEngine;
            using JargeEngine.Graphics;
            
            namespace HelloWorld
            {
                class GameScene : Scene
                {
                    public GameScene()
                    {
                        
                    }
                }
            }
            
Step 5:
      In the base function ( public GameScene() ), add the following:
      
            AddGraphic(new Text("Hello, World!"));
            
      On running the program, you have successfully printed hello world in Jarge!
